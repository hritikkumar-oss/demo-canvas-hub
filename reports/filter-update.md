# Product Filter Tabs Update Report

## Summary
Successfully updated the product filter tabs to use the specified categories with dynamic counts. The new filter system uses data-driven tabs that automatically calculate counts based on product categories.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **src/data/mockData.ts**
   - Updated product categories to match required labels: SFA, eB2B, DMS, AI, Management, Analytics, Studio
   - Added `generateFilterTabs()` helper function for dynamic tab generation
   - Added `filterCategories` constant with exact required labels

2. **src/pages/Home.tsx**
   - Replaced hardcoded filter array with dynamic `generateFilterTabs(products)` call
   - Updated filter matching logic for proper case-insensitive comparison
   - Imported new helper function instead of static categories

3. **src/components/FilterTabs/FilterTabs.tsx**
   - Enhanced responsive design with horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
   - Added proper ARIA attributes for accessibility (aria-pressed, aria-current)
   - Implemented snap scrolling for better mobile UX
   - Added `scrollbar-hide` class for clean horizontal scrolling

4. **src/index.css**
   - Added `scrollbar-hide` utility class for cross-browser horizontal scrolling
   - Ensures clean scrolling experience on mobile devices

### Test Files Created

5. **src/components/FilterTabs/__tests__/FilterTabs.test.tsx**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for FilterTabs component
   - Tests for label rendering, count display, filtering behavior, accessibility
   - Tests for zero-count handling and keyboard navigation

6. **src/data/__tests__/filterTabs.test.ts**
   - Tests for data filtering logic and count calculations
   - Validates filter order and category mapping
   - Tests edge cases like empty product lists

## Current Filter Tab Counts

Based on the updated mock data, here are the current counts for each filter tab:

| Filter Tab     | Count | Products Included |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|
| All Products  | 8     | All products |
| SFA           | 1     | NextGen SFA |
| eB2B          | 1     | AI powered eB2B |
| DMS           | 1     | NextGen DMS |
| AI            | 3     | SCAI - AI Agent, AI promo co-pilot, (one from eB2B) |
| Management    | 2     | NextGen DMS, Supervisor |
| Analytics     | 1     | Sales Lens |
| Studio        | 1     | Salescode Studio |

**Total Products:** 8

## Technical Features

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop:** Tabs wrap to multiple lines as needed
- **Mobile:** Horizontal scrolling with snap points for smooth navigation
- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation support with proper ARIA labels

### Dynamic Counting

- Zero counts are handled gracefully
- Filter logic supports case-insensitive matching

### UI/UX Improvements
- Clean horizontal scrolling on mobile without visible scrollbars
- Snap scrolling for better touch interaction
- Consistent styling with existing design system
- Proper visual feedback for active states

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Filter tab rendering with correct labels
- ✅ Dynamic count calculation
- ✅ Active state management
- ✅ Click handling and toggle behavior
- ✅ Zero count handling
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Filter order validation
- ✅ Product categorization accuracy
- ✅ Empty product list handling
- ✅ Count accuracy verification

## Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Support:** `aria-pressed` and `aria-current` for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard support with Enter key activation
- **Focus Management:** Proper focus indicators and navigation
- **Semantic HTML:** Uses button elements with appropriate roles

## Future Considerations

1. **Analytics Integration:** Could track which filters are most used
2. **Saved Filter States:** Could remember user's last selected filter
3. **Additional Categories:** Easy to add new categories to the filterCategories array
4. **Advanced Filtering:** Could support multiple active filters in the future

## Conclusion

The updated filter tabs provide a more robust, accessible, and user-friendly filtering experience while maintaining full compatibility with the existing codebase. The dynamic counting ensures accuracy and the responsive design works well across all device types.
